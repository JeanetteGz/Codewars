// Grasshopper - Function syntax debugging
// A student was working on a function and made some syntax mistakes while coding. Help them find their mistakes and fix them.

// Original code:

/* function main [verb, noun]
    return verb + noun
} */

// Corrected code:
let verb = "take item";
let noun = "use sword";

function main(verb, noun) {
    return verb + noun;
}
